This file gives an overview of the status of libgnomeuimm development.

done	= every item implemented
almost	= some stuff commented out for various reasons
partly	= there's still a lot of work
-	= category doesn't apply here == There are none to wrap.
<empty>	= you should probably volunteer to get this done

If it's "almost" or "partly" then there should be a //TODO comment
in the  file explaining why.
